# SnapScuplt

## 🏆 Introduction
  This project gives the illusion of wearing 3D glasses using only a laptop by harnessing the power of AI and a bit of post-processing. It won third place at the Colorado Technology Student Association competition!

## 🛠 Process

  1. [Mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html) is used to track the user's face in real-time
  2. These coordinates are fed into a Blender scene over a socket communication link
  3. The camera follows these coordinates to move in sync with the viewer's movements for a convincing effect
  4. Some post-processing on top gives the parallax effect.

## Weaknesses 

## 🎉 Result
In person, the effect is convincing enough to give the illusion of looking through the screen. In fact, it's more effective than 3D glasses in some cases because of the head tracking.
