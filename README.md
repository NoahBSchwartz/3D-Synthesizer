# SnapScuplt

## üè∫ Introduction
  Typically, to 3D scan a model into CAD, users have to process a video of their object for hours. This is perfect for getting the most accurate results possible, but engineers often only care about the general shape and ratios of a part in a larger assembly. ScanSculpt gives this type of rough 3D scanning its own process by relying on data from only 3 images, processed in seconds. 

## üõ† Process

  1. [Mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html) is used to track the user's face in real-time
  2. These coordinates are fed into a Blender scene over a socket communication link
  3. The camera follows these coordinates to move in sync with the viewer's movements for a convincing effect
  4. Some post-processing on top gives the parallax effect.

## Weaknesses 

## üéâ Result
In person, the effect is convincing enough to give the illusion of looking through the screen. In fact, it's more effective than 3D glasses in some cases because of the head tracking.
